        the world is a brighter place because of you. Your smile lights up my days and your laughter fills my nights with joy. 
        I am so grateful for your love and support, and I cherish every moment we spend together. 
        ill be there even you on your lowest, there's no doubt. 
        im not perfect, but i will do for you as long as my lungs breathing. 
        wish the great an every steps you made, ill always on your back. 
        Thank you for being you—for the kindness in your heart, the strength in your spirit, and the love you give so freely.
        I'm the luckiest person alive to have you in my life.  
        i always pray for you, i keep all my secrets to god. all of my pain was healed by you, you is my secrets. 
        i'll follow all your steps, follow all your fears, follow all your feels, and follow all your tears. maybe, the word of “love” meaning deadly and dangerous. 
        it means nothing by saying “i love you” to you. i love you.
